# java-test
Implement a simple Spring-based REST application with two endpoints
- Submit a word
- Retrieve the number of times a given word was submitted.

You will be evaluated in code structure, how your tests are written, what you chose to implement the requirements, and most importantly: how do you reason about the problem and how you choose the solution. Remember to speak aloud to your interviewers what you are thinking!
